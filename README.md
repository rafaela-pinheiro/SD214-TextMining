# Machine Learning for Text Mining (APM_4AI12_TP )
This repository contains code and resources for the Machine Learning for Text Mining course. The course introduces automatic text processing, from representing text numerically to applying classical machine learning algorithms on these representations.
In this course, we learned how to:
- Explain the challenges linked to textual data and associated tasks.

- Implement Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Hidden HMMs for sequence modeling.

- Work with word embeddings and vector-based representations of text.

- Apply classical machine learning methods to NLP tasks.

- Perform operations with PyTorch, including implementing and experimenting with models.

- Use Python and specialized libraries such as NLTK, Gensim, and Scikit-learn to solve practical text mining problems.
